	<h1>My Background</h1>

<p>If you click on me, I will disappear.</p>


	<p>I grew up in Indiana playing sports such as Baseball and Basketball.  I discovered my love for music around the age of 16 and began playing Guitar, Bass, Keyboards, and Drums.  After college at Indiana University, I attended audio school in Arizona and honed my skills in audio production.  I landed a job as an assistant at Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco and loved every minute of it.  From there, I moved to Colorado, where I have been doing live sound at music venues and running my own mobile recording service.  Recently, I have been studying the basics of web development, which has led me to gSchool.</p>

	Here is a picture of the famed "Hyde Street Studios".

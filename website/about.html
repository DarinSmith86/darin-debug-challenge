	<h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>

	<p>I thoroughly enjoy living on the West Coast and plan to make web development my career.  I can't think of a better career to dive into, given its rapid growth and in-demand status.  My goals for gSchool are to become comfortable with various aspects of coding relating to web development.  Although I have become somewhat familar with the basics of html and CSS, I know there is much more to learn to be an asset in the job market and I am excited to add to my skillset.  With these newly acquired skills, I hope to land a job with a reputable company that allows me to thrive in their work environment.</p>
